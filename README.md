# CellSense
Measure voltage from a RC cell pack with up to 6 cells. 

To measure the voltage from a RC-Lipo-pack with high reselution. First two cells are convert with a voltage divider. To get the voltage from the second cell it is needed to subtract the voltage from the frist cell. All other cells are converted with a differential amplifier that have "over the top" inputs.

Convert cells from 0..4,5V (pack voltage 27V) to 0..2,5V.
